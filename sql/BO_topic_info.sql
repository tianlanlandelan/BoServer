Along the way, you will learn various data mining related concepts through 6 instructional PowerPoint slides, with each followed by 3 exercises. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Note that PowerPoint slides can be directly viewed on web browsers. </span>To help you control the amount of time spent on studying, a timer is deployed through out this module. Please pay attention to the timer!</p><p><br></p><p>To fulfill the purpose of our study, we implement a leaderboard for all participants. The leaderboard will be shown once you responded to each exercise question. The leaderboard will rank you with other users who are going through the same process and will compete with you in this training module. Your competitors are randomly assigned but will remain the same throughout the session. You will be awarded points based on accuracy and speed; i.e., 100 points for getting it correct, plus 0-90 points based on your speed. You will see a 90-second timer on screen when going through each exercise question. Keep in mind that an incorrect answer is always 0, regardless of speed. <br></p><p><br></p><p>The estimated time for this learning module is approximately 50 minutes. Have fun!<br></p>', null, '2019-10-17 23:06:41', null, 'Welcome!
